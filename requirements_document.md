# MealSmart Application Requirements

## 1. User Account and Preference Management

   - **Task 1.1**: Setup a user authentication system. Python's Flask-Login module could be beneficial in this task.
   - **Task 1.2**: Store user's preferences like food preferences, allergies, and budget. Python's SQLAlchemy might be useful for efficient database operations.

## 2. Meal Plan Generation 

   - **Task 2.1**: Create an algorithm that can generate meal plans based on the user's preferences. Python's pandas library will ensure efficient data handling.
   - **Task 2.2**: Implement functionality for users to customize their meal plans. Websockets using Flask-SocketIO could be utilized for real-time interaction.

## 3. Recipe and Shopping List Compilation

   - **Task 3.1**: Link each meal plan to specific recipes (that respect the user's preferences). Python's pandas library can be used again for data management.
   - **Task 3.2**: Generate a shopping list based on the meal plan and provide ability to modify it. Here again, Flask-SocketIO can be used for real-time updates.

## 4. Web Interface and User Experience

   - **Task 4.1**: Design a user-friendly web interface for user to interact. This includes entering preferences, viewing meal plans, recipes and shopping list. Flask and Bootstrap could be utilized together.
   - **Task 4.2**: Implement user feedback system to iterate and improve the application. Python's Flask-WTF can support creating web forms easily. 

This document can serve as a preliminary set of tasks for the Python development team. It balances the high-level user necessities and the corresponding development tasks, allowing the team to start on a solid foundation. Further sub-tasks may be identified as development proceeds.
